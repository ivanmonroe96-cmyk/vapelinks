    "content": "<h2>Getting Started with Vaping</h2><p>If you're new to vaping, the sheer number of devices, e-liquids and accessories on the market can feel overwhelming. Don't worry — this guide will walk you through everything you need to know to pick the right vape for your needs and preferences.</p><h2>Understanding the Different Types of Vapes</h2><p>There are several main categories of vaping devices, each suited to different users:</p><ul><li><strong>Disposable vapes</strong> — Ready to use straight out of the box with no setup required. Great for trying vaping for the first time, but not the most cost-effective long term.</li><li><strong>Pod systems</strong> — Compact, lightweight devices that use replaceable or refillable pods. Perfect for beginners who want something simple but reusable.</li><li><strong>Vape pens</strong> — Slim, pen-shaped devices with a built-in tank. A solid middle ground between simplicity and performance.</li><li><strong>Box mods</strong> — Larger, more powerful devices with adjustable settings. Best for experienced vapers who want full control over their experience.</li></ul><p>For most beginners, we recommend starting with a pod system. They're affordable, easy to maintain, and deliver a satisfying experience without the complexity. Check out our <a href=\"/collections/pod-systems\">pod systems collection</a> for popular options.</p><h2>Choosing the Right Nicotine Strength</h2><p>Nicotine strength is one of the most important decisions you'll make. E-liquids typically come in several strengths:</p><ul><li><strong>0mg</strong> — Nicotine-free, for those who enjoy the act of vaping without nicotine.</li><li><strong>3mg–6mg</strong> — Low strength, suited for light smokers or those who prefer minimal nicotine.</li><li><strong>12mg–18mg</strong> — Medium strength, common for regular smokers transitioning to vaping.</li><li><strong>20mg+ (nic salts)</strong> — Higher strength nicotine salts, designed for pod systems and mouth-to-lung devices.</li></ul><p>If you're unsure, start with a mid-range strength and adjust from there. You can always change your nicotine level once you know what feels right.</p><h2>PG/VG Ratio Basics</h2><p>E-liquids are made from two base ingredients: Propylene Glycol (PG) and Vegetable Glycerine (VG). The ratio affects your experience:</p><ul><li><strong>Higher PG (50/50 or 60PG/40VG)</strong> — Stronger throat hit, more flavour, less vapour. Best for pod systems and MTL vaping.</li><li><strong>Higher VG (70VG/30PG or 80VG/20PG)</strong> — Smoother draw, bigger clouds, slightly muted flavour. Best for sub-ohm and DTL devices.</li></ul><p>Most beginners do well with a 50/50 blend in a pod system. For a deeper dive, read our guide on <a href=\"/blog/understanding-e-liquid-pg-vs-vg-ratios-explained\">PG vs VG ratios</a>.</p><h2>Budget Considerations</h2><p>Your budget will influence which type of device you go for. Pod systems and starter kits are the most affordable entry point, typically ranging from $30 to $60 for the device itself. You'll also need to factor in the ongoing cost of pods or coils and e-liquid.</p><p>While disposable vapes have a lower upfront cost, they work out more expensive over time compared to a reusable device. Investing in a quality starter kit will save you money in the long run.</p><h2>Our Recommendation</h2><p>For most first-time vapers, we suggest grabbing a reliable pod system kit, a 50/50 e-liquid in a flavour you enjoy, and a spare pack of pods or coils. Browse our <a href=\"/collections/starter-kits\">starter kits</a> to find everything you need to get going. If you have any questions, the Vapelink team is always happy to help.</p>"

    "content": "<h2>Two Popular Choices, Very Different Experiences</h2><p>When it comes to vaping devices, pod systems and box mods sit at opposite ends of the spectrum. Pod systems prioritise portability and simplicity, while box mods offer power and customisation. In this article, we'll break down the key differences so you can decide which one is right for you.</p><h2>What Is a Pod System?</h2><p>A pod system is a compact vaping device that uses small, replaceable pods filled with e-liquid. They're typically draw-activated (no button required), making them incredibly easy to use. Most pod systems are designed for mouth-to-lung (MTL) vaping, which closely mimics the sensation of smoking a cigarette.</p><h3>Pros of Pod Systems</h3><ul><li>Lightweight, pocketable and discreet</li><li>Minimal setup — often just click in a pod and you're ready</li><li>Lower upfront cost</li><li>Great for nicotine salts and higher-strength e-liquids</li><li>Very beginner-friendly</li></ul><h3>Cons of Pod Systems</h3><ul><li>Smaller battery capacity — may need charging during the day</li><li>Less vapour production compared to box mods</li><li>Fewer customisation options</li><li>Pod replacement costs can add up</li></ul><p>Browse our range of <a href=\"/collections/pod-systems\">pod systems</a> to see what's available.</p><h2>What Is a Box Mod?</h2><p>A box mod is a larger, more powerful vaping device with adjustable wattage, temperature control, and other advanced features. They pair with external tanks and use replaceable coils, giving you full control over your vaping experience. Box mods are preferred by experienced vapers who enjoy sub-ohm vaping and big cloud production.</p><h3>Pros of Box Mods</h3><ul><li>High power output for massive clouds and intense flavour</li><li>Adjustable wattage and temperature settings</li><li>Longer battery life with larger or dual batteries</li><li>Wide range of compatible tanks and coils</li><li>Highly customisable experience</li></ul><h3>Cons of Box Mods</h3><ul><li>Bulkier and heavier — less convenient to carry</li><li>Steeper learning curve for beginners</li><li>Higher upfront cost</li><li>Requires more maintenance and knowledge</li></ul><p>See our <a href=\"/collections/box-mods\">box mods collection</a> for the latest devices.</p><h2>Which Should You Choose?</h2><p>The best device depends on what you value most:</p><ul><li><strong>Choose a pod system</strong> if you want simplicity, portability and an easy transition from smoking. They're ideal for everyday carry and casual vaping.</li><li><strong>Choose a box mod</strong> if you want maximum control, bigger clouds and don't mind a larger device. They're ideal for hobbyist vapers who enjoy fine-tuning their setup.</li></ul><p>Many vapers own both — a pod system for on-the-go convenience and a box mod for home use. There's no wrong answer, only what works best for your lifestyle.</p><h2>Still Not Sure?</h2><p>If you're just starting out, we generally recommend beginning with a pod system and upgrading to a box mod later if you want more power.

    "content": "<h2>What Does a Vape Coil Do?</h2><p>The coil is the heating element inside your vape tank or pod. When you press the fire button (or take a draw on an auto-draw device), the coil heats up and vapourises the e-liquid soaked into its wicking material. Over time, this wicking material degrades and residue builds up on the coil, which affects the flavour and vapour production of your device.</p><h2>How Long Do Coils Last?</h2><p>On average, a vape coil lasts between one and three weeks, depending on several factors:</p><ul><li><strong>How often you vape</strong> — Heavy use wears coils out faster.</li><li><strong>E-liquid sweetness</strong> — Sweeter e-liquids caramelise on the coil and gunk it up more quickly.</li><li><strong>Wattage</strong> — Running your coil at higher wattage than recommended can burn it out prematurely.</li><li><strong>Priming</strong> — Not properly priming a new coil can cause it to burn out immediately.</li></ul><h2>Signs Your Coil Needs Replacing</h2><p>Keep an eye out for these telltale signs:</p><ul><li><strong>Burnt taste</strong> — The most obvious sign. If you're getting a harsh, burnt flavour, your coil is done.</li><li><strong>Reduced flavour</strong> — When the flavour starts tasting muted or \"off\", the coil is wearing out.</li><li><strong>Less vapour</strong> — A noticeable drop in vapour production usually means the coil isn't heating efficiently.</li><li><strong>Gurgling sounds</strong> — While this can have other causes, a worn coil can contribute to gurgling and spitting.</li><li><strong>Dark e-liquid</strong> — If your e-liquid turns noticeably darker in the tank, residue from the coil may be discolouring it.</li></ul><h2>How to Replace a Coil</h2><p>Replacing a coil is straightforward. Here's the general process for most tank-style devices:</p><ol><li>Empty any remaining e-liquid from your tank.</li><li>Unscrew the base of the tank to access the coil.</li><li>Unscrew or pull out the old coil and discard it.</li><li>Screw or push the new coil into place.</li><li>Reassemble the tank and fill with e-liquid.</li><li><strong>Prime the coil</strong> — Apply a few drops of e-liquid directly onto the exposed cotton on the new coil. This saturates the wick and prevents dry hits.</li><li>Let the filled tank sit for 5–10 minutes before vaping to allow the coil to fully saturate.</li></ol><p>For pod systems, coil replacement usually involves simply swapping the entire pod or clicking in a replacement coil, depending on the design.</p><h2>Tips to Make Your Coils Last Longer</h2><ul><li>Always prime new coils before use.</li><li>Don't chain vape — give the wick a few seconds to re-saturate between draws.</li><li>Stay within the recommended wattage range printed on the coil.</li><li>Use e-liquids with less sweetener to reduce gunking.</li><li>Keep your tank topped up — vaping on a low tank can expose the wick and cause dry hits.</li></ul><p>Need replacement coils?

    "content": "<h2>What Are PG and VG?</h2><p>Every e-liquid is made from a combination of two base liquids: Propylene Glycol (PG) and Vegetable Glycerine (VG). These are food-grade substances that have been used in consumer products for decades. Together with flavouring and optionally nicotine, they make up the e-liquid you vape.</p><h3>Propylene Glycol (PG)</h3><p>PG is a thin, odourless liquid that carries flavour extremely well. It produces a noticeable \"throat hit\" — that slight kick at the back of your throat that many former smokers find satisfying. Because it's thinner, PG is easily absorbed by the coil's wicking material, making it well suited for smaller, lower-powered devices like pod systems.</p><h3>Vegetable Glycerine (VG)</h3><p>VG is a thicker, slightly sweet liquid that produces significantly more vapour than PG. It delivers a smoother, less noticeable throat hit. Because of its viscosity, VG works best in more powerful devices with larger wicking ports, such as sub-ohm tanks and box mods.</p><h2>Common PG/VG Ratios and When to Use Them</h2><h3>50/50 (50PG/50VG)</h3><p>The most versatile ratio. It offers a balanced mix of throat hit, flavour and vapour production. This is the go-to for most pod systems and mouth-to-lung (MTL) vape pens. If you're not sure what ratio to start with, 50/50 is a safe bet.</p><h3>70VG/30PG</h3><p>A popular choice for sub-ohm vapers. The higher VG content produces thicker clouds and a smoother draw, while the 30% PG still ensures decent flavour. This ratio is commonly used in direct-to-lung (DTL) setups.</p><h3>80VG/20PG or Max VG</h3><p>Designed for cloud chasers and high-powered devices. Maximum vapour production with a very smooth inhale. Flavour can be slightly muted compared to higher-PG blends, but the cloud output is impressive.</p><h3>70PG/30VG or Higher PG</h3><p>Less common but preferred by some MTL vapers who want a stronger throat hit and maximum flavour intensity. Can be too harsh for some users, especially at higher nicotine strengths.</p><h2>Matching Your Ratio to Your Device</h2><p>Using the wrong PG/VG ratio in your device can cause problems:</p><ul><li><strong>High VG in a pod system</strong> — The thick liquid may not wick properly, leading to dry hits and burnt coils.</li><li><strong>High PG in a sub-ohm tank</strong> — Can cause leaking, because PG is thinner and flows more freely through the larger coil ports.</li></ul><p>As a general rule: use 50/50 or higher-PG liquids in pod systems and MTL devices, and use 70VG/30PG or higher-VG liquids in sub-ohm and DTL devices.</p><h2>What About Nicotine Salts?</h2><p>Nicotine salt e-liquids are almost always 50/50 PG/VG and are formulated for low-powered pod systems. They deliver nicotine more efficiently and with less throat harshness than traditional freebase nicotine, even at higher strengths. If you're using a pod system, nic salts are often the best choice.</p><p>Ready to find the right e-liquid?

    "content": "<h2>Why Maintenance Matters</h2><p>Your vape is an investment. Whether you're using a simple pod system or a high-end box mod, a little regular care goes a long way toward keeping it performing at its best and avoiding costly replacements. Here are five straightforward maintenance tips every vaper should know.</p><h2>1. Clean Your Tank Regularly</h2><p>Residue from e-liquid builds up inside your tank over time, which can affect flavour and even cause your device to underperform. Every time you change your coil or switch flavours, give your tank a quick rinse under warm water and let it air dry completely before reassembling. For a more thorough clean, check out our <a href=\"/blog/how-to-clean-your-vape-tank\">step-by-step tank cleaning guide</a>.</p><h2>2. Prime Your Coils Properly</h2><p>One of the most common mistakes new vapers make is firing a new coil without priming it first. Before installing a new coil, apply a few drops of e-liquid directly onto the exposed cotton wicking ports. After filling your tank, let it sit for at least five minutes before taking your first draw. This prevents the dreaded dry hit and helps your coil last longer.</p><h2>3. Don't Let Your Tank Run Dry</h2><p>Vaping with a near-empty tank exposes the coil's wicking material to air, which can cause it to burn. Try to refill your tank before the e-liquid level drops below the wicking ports. This simple habit can significantly extend the life of your coils.</p><h2>4. Store Your Device Properly</h2><p>Avoid leaving your vape in direct sunlight, in a hot car, or in extremely cold conditions. Heat can degrade e-liquid and damage batteries, while extreme cold can reduce battery performance. Store your device upright when possible to prevent leaking, and keep it in a case or pouch to protect it from dust and pocket lint.</p><h2>5. Keep Your Battery Contacts Clean</h2><p>Dirty battery contacts can cause poor electrical connections, leading to inconsistent performance or your device not firing at all. Use a dry cotton bud or a slightly damp cloth to gently clean the contact points on both your battery and your tank or pod. Do this every couple of weeks or whenever you notice debris.</p><h2>Bonus Tip: Replace Worn Parts on Time</h2><p>Coils, pods, seals and drip tips all wear out over time. Don't wait until something fails completely — replace parts at the first sign of reduced performance. Keeping spare coils and pods on hand means you're never caught out. Browse our <a href=\"/collections/accessories\">accessories</a> for replacement parts and everything else you need to keep your device running smoothly.</p>"

    "content": "<h2>What Is Sub-Ohm Vaping?</h2><p>Sub-ohm vaping refers to using a coil with a resistance below 1.0 ohm. The lower resistance allows more electrical current to flow through the coil, which generates more heat and produces significantly more vapour and flavour compared to standard coils. It's the preferred style for vapers who enjoy big clouds and intense taste.</p><h2>How Does It Differ from Standard Vaping?</h2><p>Standard or \"above-ohm\" vaping uses coils with a resistance of 1.0 ohm or higher. These setups are typically used in pod systems and mouth-to-lung (MTL) devices, which produce less vapour and focus on a tighter, cigarette-like draw. Sub-ohm vaping, by contrast, uses a direct-to-lung (DTL) inhale — you breathe the vapour directly into your lungs like taking a deep breath.</p><h3>Key Differences at a Glance</h3><ul><li><strong>Vapour production</strong> — Sub-ohm produces significantly more vapour.</li><li><strong>Flavour intensity</strong> — Lower resistance coils tend to deliver more intense flavour.</li><li><strong>Throat hit</strong> — Sub-ohm vaping has a smoother, less pronounced throat hit.</li><li><strong>E-liquid consumption</strong> — Sub-ohm devices use more e-liquid per session.</li><li><strong>Battery usage</strong> — Higher power draw means faster battery drain.</li><li><strong>Nicotine strength</strong> — Sub-ohm vapers typically use lower nicotine (3mg–6mg) because the increased vapour delivers more nicotine per puff.</li></ul><h2>What Equipment Do You Need?</h2><p>To get started with sub-ohm vaping, you'll need:</p><ul><li><strong>A sub-ohm capable device</strong> — Box mods and some advanced vape pens can handle sub-ohm coils. Make sure your device supports the wattage range required by your coil.</li><li><strong>A sub-ohm tank</strong> — These tanks have larger airflow openings and use coils rated below 1.0 ohm. Many come with adjustable airflow control.</li><li><strong>High-VG e-liquid</strong> — A 70VG/30PG ratio or higher is recommended. High-PG liquids can be too harsh when sub-ohm vaping.</li><li><strong>Quality batteries</strong> — Sub-ohm vaping draws more current from your batteries. Use high-drain batteries from reputable brands and follow proper <a href=\"/blog/battery-safety-essential-tips-for-vape-users\">battery safety practices</a>.</li></ul><p>Check out our <a href=\"/collections/box-mods\">box mods</a> and <a href=\"/collections/tanks\">tanks</a> for sub-ohm ready setups.</p><h2>Is Sub-Ohm Vaping Right for You?</h2><p>Sub-ohm vaping is best suited for experienced vapers who want maximum flavour and cloud production. It's not typically recommended for beginners or those who prefer a tight, cigarette-style draw. If you're still new to vaping, start with a pod system or MTL device and work your way up once you're comfortable with the basics.</p><h2>Safety Considerations</h2><p>Sub-ohm vaping puts greater demands on your battery, so safety is important:</p><ul><li>Use regulated devices with built-in safety protections.</li><li>Never exceed the recommended wattage range for your coil.</li><li>Use batteries rated for high-drain applications.</li><li>Don't use damaged batteries or wraps.</li></ul><p>As long as you follow these guidelines and use quality equipment, sub-ohm vaping is a safe and enjoyable experience.</p>"

    "content": "<h2>Why Battery Safety Matters</h2><p>Most modern vaping devices use lithium-ion batteries, the same type of battery found in smartphones, laptops and electric vehicles. When used correctly, they're extremely safe. However, mishandling or using damaged batteries can lead to problems. Understanding a few basic safety principles will keep you vaping safely for years to come.</p><h2>1. Use the Right Batteries</h2><p>If your device uses removable batteries (common in box mods), always use high-quality, high-drain 18650 or 21700 batteries from reputable manufacturers. Never use random batteries from unknown brands. The batteries need to be rated for the current your device draws — check the continuous discharge rating (CDR) and make sure it exceeds your device's requirements.</p><h2>2. Inspect Your Battery Wraps</h2><p>The thin plastic wrap around your battery is a critical safety feature. It insulates the battery and prevents short circuits. Before every use, give your batteries a quick visual check:</p><ul><li>Look for tears, nicks or peeling in the wrap.</li><li>Check for dents or damage to the battery itself.</li><li>Make sure the positive terminal insulator ring is intact.</li></ul><p>If you spot any damage, stop using the battery immediately. You can either re-wrap it with a replacement battery wrap or replace the battery entirely.</p><h2>3. Use the Right Charger</h2><p>Always charge your batteries with a dedicated external charger designed for lithium-ion cells. While many devices offer USB charging, an external charger is generally safer and better for battery longevity because it charges each cell evenly. Never leave batteries charging unattended overnight or on flammable surfaces.</p><h2>4. Don't Overcharge or Over-Discharge</h2><p>Most quality chargers and regulated devices have built-in protections against overcharging and over-discharging. However, it's still good practice to:</p><ul><li>Remove batteries from the charger once they're full.</li><li>Don't vape your device until the battery is completely flat — recharge when your device indicates low battery.</li><li>Avoid charging batteries that feel unusually hot.</li></ul><h2>5. Store and Transport Batteries Safely</h2><p>Loose batteries in a pocket or bag can come into contact with metal objects like keys or coins, causing a short circuit. This is one of the most common causes of battery incidents and it's entirely preventable:</p><ul><li>Always store spare batteries in a dedicated battery case.</li><li>Never carry loose batteries in your pocket.</li><li>Keep batteries away from extreme heat and direct sunlight.</li><li>Store batteries at room temperature in a dry environment.</li></ul><h2>6. Replace Old Batteries</h2><p>Lithium-ion batteries degrade over time, even with careful use. If you notice your batteries aren't holding a charge like they used to, or they've been in use for over a year of regular vaping, it's time to replace them. Fresh batteries perform better and are safer.</p><h2>7. Only Use Regulated Devices</h2><p>Regulated mods have built-in safety chips that protect against short circuits, over-discharge, overcharging and overheating. Unless you're an experienced vaper with a thorough understanding of Ohm's law and battery safety, stick with regulated devices.</p><p>Following these simple guidelines ensures your vaping experience stays safe and enjoyable.

    "content": "<h2>Two Ways to Inhale</h2><p>If you've spent any time researching vapes, you've probably come across the terms MTL and DTL. These refer to two different inhalation techniques, and the one you prefer will dictate what kind of device, coil and e-liquid you should use. Let's break it down.</p><h2>What Is Mouth-to-Lung (MTL) Vaping?</h2><p>Mouth-to-lung vaping is a two-step inhale: you first draw the vapour into your mouth, then inhale it into your lungs. This is the same technique most people use when smoking a cigarette, which is why MTL vaping is popular with those transitioning from smoking.</p><h3>Characteristics of MTL Vaping</h3><ul><li><strong>Tighter draw</strong> — MTL devices have restricted airflow, creating resistance when you inhale.</li><li><strong>Less vapour</strong> — Produces a moderate amount of vapour, which is more discreet.</li><li><strong>Stronger throat hit</strong> — The tighter draw combined with higher-PG e-liquids delivers a satisfying throat sensation.</li><li><strong>Higher nicotine</strong> — MTL setups work well with higher nicotine strengths (12mg–20mg) and nicotine salts.</li><li><strong>Lower power</strong> — Typically used with coils above 1.0 ohm at lower wattages (8–25W).</li></ul><p>MTL devices include most pod systems, vape pens and some tanks with tighter airflow settings. Check out our <a href=\"/collections/pod-systems\">pod systems</a> for great MTL options.</p><h2>What Is Direct-to-Lung (DTL) Vaping?</h2><p>Direct-to-lung vaping is a single-step inhale: you breathe the vapour directly into your lungs in one go, similar to taking a deep breath. DTL is favoured by vapers who enjoy big clouds and intense flavour.</p><h3>Characteristics of DTL Vaping</h3><ul><li><strong>Open airflow</strong> — DTL devices have wide-open airflow for an unrestricted, airy draw.</li><li><strong>More vapour</strong> — Produces large, dense clouds of vapour.</li><li><strong>Smoother hit</strong> — The open draw and higher-VG e-liquids make for a very smooth inhale.</li><li><strong>Lower nicotine</strong> — Because more vapour is inhaled per puff, DTL vapers use lower nicotine (3mg–6mg).</li><li><strong>Higher power</strong> — Uses sub-ohm coils (below 1.0 ohm) at higher wattages (30–100W+).</li></ul><p>DTL setups include box mods with sub-ohm tanks and some advanced pod mods. See our <a href=\"/collections/box-mods\">box mods</a> for popular DTL devices.</p><h2>Which Style Is Better?</h2><p>Neither is objectively better — it comes down to personal preference:</p><ul><li><strong>Choose MTL</strong> if you want a cigarette-like experience, prefer discretion, or are new to vaping. MTL is simpler, uses less e-liquid and is more forgiving for beginners.</li><li><strong>Choose DTL</strong> if you want maximum flavour and cloud production, enjoy a smooth and airy draw, and don't mind using more e-liquid.</li></ul><h2>Matching Your Setup</h2><p>Using the right combination of device, coil and e-liquid for your inhalation style is important:</p><ul><li><strong>MTL</strong> — Pod system or MTL tank, coils above 1.0 ohm, 50/50 PG/VG e-liquid, 12mg–20mg nicotine or nic salts.</li><li><strong>DTL</strong> — Box mod or sub-ohm device, coils below 1.0 ohm, 70VG/30PG or higher-VG e-liquid, 3mg–6mg nicotine.</li></ul><p>Not sure which style suits you?

    "content": "<h2>The Disposable Boom</h2><p>Disposable vapes have exploded in popularity over the past few years, and it's not hard to see why. They're cheap upfront, require zero setup and come ready to use straight out of the packaging. But is that convenience worth it in the long run? Let's compare disposables with reusable kits across the factors that matter most.</p><h2>Convenience</h2><h3>Disposable Vapes</h3><p>Maximum convenience. Unwrap, vape, dispose. No charging (in most cases), no refilling, no coil changes. When it runs out, you grab a new one. For people who want the absolute simplest experience, disposables can't be beaten.</p><h3>Reusable Kits</h3><p>Slightly more involved, but still quite simple — especially with modern pod systems. You'll need to charge the device, refill or replace pods, and occasionally swap coils. Once you're in the routine, it takes less than a minute. Most reusable devices charge via USB-C, which is quick and convenient.</p><h2>Cost</h2><h3>Disposable Vapes</h3><p>Cheaper upfront but more expensive over time. If you're vaping regularly, the cost of disposables adds up quickly. A daily vaper might spend significantly more per month on disposables compared to refillable pods and e-liquid.</p><h3>Reusable Kits</h3><p>Higher initial investment, but dramatically cheaper in the long run. A quality pod system costs $30–$60 upfront, and ongoing costs for e-liquid and replacement pods or coils are a fraction of what you'd spend on disposables. Over six months, the savings are substantial.</p><h2>Flavour and Performance</h2><h3>Disposable Vapes</h3><p>Disposables offer decent flavour, but because the coil degrades throughout the life of the device, the quality drops off toward the end. You're also limited to whatever flavours are available in disposable format.</p><h3>Reusable Kits</h3><p>Refillable devices generally offer better and more consistent flavour, especially when you're using a fresh coil. You also have access to a vastly wider range of e-liquids — any flavour, any nicotine strength, any PG/VG ratio.</p><h2>Environmental Impact</h2><h3>Disposable Vapes</h3><p>This is the biggest drawback. Disposable vapes create electronic waste — each unit contains a lithium battery, a circuit board and plastic housing that typically end up in landfill. The environmental cost is significant, especially at scale.</p><h3>Reusable Kits</h3><p>Far less wasteful. The device itself lasts months or years, and only small components like pods and coils need regular replacement. While not zero-waste, reusable kits are a much more environmentally responsible choice.</p><h2>Our Verdict</h2><p>Disposables have their place — they're great for trying vaping for the first time or as a backup when your main device is charging. But for regular vapers, a reusable kit is the smarter choice on almost every front: cost, performance, flavour variety and environmental impact.</p><p>Ready to make the switch? Browse our <a href=\"/collections/pod-systems\">pod systems</a> and <a href=\"/collections/starter-kits\">starter kits</a> to find a reusable setup that suits you.

    "content": "<h2>Every Vaper Has Been There</h2><p>Even the best vaping devices can run into issues from time to time. The good news is that most common problems have simple fixes. Before you assume your device is broken, run through this troubleshooting guide — chances are you'll have it sorted in minutes.</p><h2>Problem: Burnt or Dry Taste</h2><p>A harsh, burnt flavour is the most common vape complaint. Here's what causes it and how to fix it:</p><ul><li><strong>Coil needs replacing</strong> — If your coil is more than a week or two old, it's likely burnt out. Replace it with a fresh one and prime it properly before use.</li><li><strong>Not enough e-liquid</strong> — If the tank is near-empty, the wick can't saturate. Top up your tank.</li><li><strong>Wattage too high</strong> — Running your coil above its recommended wattage can burn the wick. Check the coil's wattage range and adjust your device accordingly.</li><li><strong>Chain vaping</strong> — Taking lots of puffs in quick succession doesn't give the wick time to re-saturate. Pause a few seconds between draws.</li><li><strong>New coil not primed</strong> — Always apply e-liquid to the cotton on a new coil and let the filled tank sit for 5–10 minutes before vaping.</li></ul><h2>Problem: Leaking Tank</h2><p>E-liquid seeping out of your tank is frustrating but usually fixable:</p><ul><li><strong>Check the seals</strong> — Make sure all o-rings are in place and undamaged. Replace any that look worn or stretched.</li><li><strong>Tighten connections</strong> — Ensure the coil, base and top cap are all properly tightened. Don't over-tighten though — that can damage seals.</li><li><strong>Wrong PG/VG ratio</strong> — Thin, high-PG e-liquids can leak through sub-ohm coils designed for thicker VG-heavy liquids. Match your e-liquid to your coil type.</li><li><strong>Filling technique</strong> — When filling, avoid getting e-liquid down the centre chimney. Tilt the tank slightly and pour down the inner wall.</li><li><strong>Worn coil</strong> — Old coils can lose their seal. Try a fresh coil if the leak persists.</li></ul><h2>Problem: No Vapour or Weak Vapour</h2><p>If you're pressing the fire button and getting nothing or very little vapour:</p><ul><li><strong>Check the battery</strong> — Is your device charged? Plug it in and try again.</li><li><strong>Check the coil connection</strong> — Remove and reseat the coil to make sure it's making proper contact.</li><li><strong>Check for a locked device</strong> — Many mods lock when you press the fire button five times. Press five times rapidly to unlock.</li><li><strong>Airflow blocked</strong> — Make sure the airflow ring isn't fully closed.</li><li><strong>Flooded coil</strong> — If you hear gurgling, the coil may be flooded. Blow gently through the mouthpiece (with a paper towel over the airflow) to clear excess liquid.</li></ul><h2>Problem: Gurgling or Spitting</h2><p>Hearing bubbling sounds or getting hot liquid on your lips? That's a flooded coil:</p><ul><li><strong>Flick excess liquid</strong> — Hold the device upside down and flick it firmly (over a sink or paper towel) to remove excess e-liquid from the coil.</li><li><strong>Blow through the device</strong> — A gentle blow through the mouthpiece can clear the flooding.</li><li><strong>Increase wattage slightly</strong> — A slightly higher wattage can vapourise excess liquid more effectively.</li><li><strong>Check your coil</strong> — A very worn coil doesn't vapourise efficiently, leading to flooding. Replace it if needed.</li></ul><h2>Problem: E-Liquid Tastes Off or Muted</h2><p>If the flavour isn't what it used to be:</p><ul><li><strong>Coil is wearing out</strong> — This is the most common cause. Fresh coil, fresh flavour.</li><li><strong>Dirty tank</strong> — E-liquid residue can build up and affect taste. Give your tank a thorough clean. See our <a href=\"/blog/how-to-clean-your-vape-tank\">tank cleaning guide</a> for instructions.</li><li><strong>Vaper's tongue</strong> — If you've been vaping the same flavour for a long time, your taste buds can become desensitised. Try switching to a different flavour for a few days.</li></ul><h2>When to Ask for Help</h2><p>If you've tried the fixes above and your device still isn't performing properly, it may be a hardware issue. Get in touch with the Vapelink team and we'll help you troubleshoot further.
